                    <p>I've taken a break from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>
                    in order to learn more about HTML and CSS. JavaScript makes more sense to me now, however the problem solving aspect
                    of it still eludes me. The logic is straight forward but also very difficult if you don't have a reference point.
                    I recently revamped this portoflio and I am very proud of it. I've noticed that, whilst not crucial, it certainly
                    helps to have a background in graphic design, since I don't need a web designer to make a decent looking website.
                    I have many ideas for website designs, however I lack the skills to bring them to fruition. If I could give a good
                    analogy, it feels like I'm a guitarist trying to learn how to play the clarinet. I have a good foundation in one 
                    aspect of the skill so I have a head start, but it's only getting me so far. In the end, I'm very happy with what
                    I've created, and I've come a long way.</p>

                    <p>
                    Today I started <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Fundamentals Part 5</a>
                    after completing the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Etch-a-Sketch</a> project
                    <a href="https://syvit.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/">(finished product)</a>. I am now 89% of the way through the fundamentals portion of <a href="theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOP</a>,
                    and hopefully it shouldn't take more than a week to finish the rest. This current section focuses on objects and array methods, which seem to be very important.
                    Now that that's out of the way, the main purpose of this blog entry is to show the current state of the website, since I reworked it last week and forgot
                    to post a screenshot.

                    <p>
                    I have finally made it passed the <a href="https://syvit.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a> assignment on 
                    <a href="theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOP</a>. In the first
                    week or so I made it 85% of the way through <a href="theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOP</a>'s foundations course, and about another month to make
                    it from 85% to 87%. To be fair, I barely touched the project during that time so I could spend more time honing my skills instead of 
                    reading articles. I've been lazier than I wanted to be, but I feel like I'm really getting the hang of JavaScript. I would say my 
                    method of spending 13 hours a day studying in the beginning was ultimately excessive and probably made it harder for me to soak up
                    information. My new strategy for <a href="theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOP</a> is to use 
                    <a href="https://netninja.dev/courses/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Net Ninja's</a>
                    course as a buffer when I'm having trouble processing information. It was only $5, so it was definitely worth the purchase.

                    <p>
                    I'm going to start posting less now, but make more important updates. I recently stopped the <a
                        href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/lecture/22587506#overview"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udemy</a>
                    course as I have developed my knowledge of HTML and CSS to an intermidiate level, and want to learn
                    through
                    more thorough means.
                    Ironically this means using a free, Ubuntu (Linux) based course called <a
                        href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin
                        Project</a>. It seems very difficult, and very in depth on both front end and back end development.
                    I
                    will likely only post on this website
                    once every few days at most, just because I won't always have much to write about, and I will likely
                    make a
                    new portfolio when
                    the time comes. I spent about 4 hours today just learning and getting used to Ubuntu and git, and while
                    it's
                    somewhat tricky, I have full confidence that
                    I will become very proficient in using them with time and practice.

                    <p>
                        I spent most of today focusing on reworking the website, and I've gotten it to a point that I really
                        like, however it still has a long way to go.
                        I feel more comfortable with CSS than ever, but it feels like i'm just throwing things where I think
                        they should go and hoping it works. I plan on
                        doing some code alongs using the <a
                            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/lecture/22587506#overview"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udemy</a>
                        course, but
                        also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja/videos" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">The Net Ninja</a>, and <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The
                            Coding Train</a>.
                        I will also start looking around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DevTipsForDesigners/videos"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevTips</a> channel for an extra
                        reference. This is the
                        current state of my website:                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think it's best for me to take a breather and practice
                        what I've already learned by making
                        new websites. The next step in the <a
                            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/lecture/22587506#overview"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udemy</a>
                        course is Bootstrap, a css framework. It seems like a method of using CSS without knowing the basics
                        of
                        CSS,
                        and that scares me because I think it would be detrimental to me in the future. I'm not sure how
                        long I
                        will spend
                        on practicing, but it will likely take a couple of weeks. I realize that I don't need to memorize
                        everything, and will likely always have to reference
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN</a>
                        even
                        after I get the job I want. It's only been
                        five days
                        but I've understood every concept thus far, and I think practicing will help me get my organization
                        down
                        and will help me to understand
                        when to use certain styling methods over others.

                    <p>I'm writing this on the 28th because I spent 12 hours practicing and fried my poor brain, but to sum
                        it
                        up I learned about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position" target="_blank"

                        and most
                        importantly <a

                        I'm particularly
                        excited about learning and using flexbox because my biggest hurdle so far has been positioning
                        elements
                        in a way that doesn't seem messy, and this
                        is definitely the solution I was looking for.

                        Today I've become much more aquainted with CSS structure and specificity. I've already made quite a
                        lot
                        of progress
                        and this page is the proof of that. For some reason CSS makes a lot of sense to me even compared to
                        HTML
                        which is a
                        little less "natural" if you want to call it that. I also have an exntensive background in graphic
                        design which is
                        most likely the reason why I like CSS so much. I also have some prior experience in CSS through
                        rainmeter skin editing
                        which I wasn't even aware of. My computer experience is paying off a lot.

                        I spent today learning HTML forms and the very basics of CSS. Honestly CSS makes a lot of sense to
                        me so
                        far, and I'm very excited
                        to learn more about it. I think once I get a good enough grasp on HTML and CSS I will take a break
                        and
                        just
                        focus on developing this website.
                        I am currently testing the CSS on the <a href="aboutme.html">about me</a> page.

                        Today I spent learning what HTML5 is specifcally in relation to HTML, aswell as the basics of
                        semantic
                        HTML
                        (You wont be able to see this
                        on the page unless you inspect element). I have also picked up a few tricks pertaining
                        to Emmet, which is a more efficient way of typing elements and tags. I left off on learning tables,
                        which is
                        definitely going to take
                        some time to get used to, but overall not too complicated.
